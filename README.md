<h2><b>🌟 EcoContext VoxID: Voice Recognition with a Green Twist! 🌍</b></h2><br>
Welcome to EcoContext VoxID, a cutting-edge Python application that blends voice identification with intelligent, context-aware energy optimization. Powered by a sleek neural network and fuzzy logic, this system identifies users through unique voiceprints, adapts to real-world environments, and sips power like a pro—all wrapped in a vibrant Tkinter GUI. Ready to revolutionize voice tech? Let’s dive in! 🎙️⚡️<br>

<h3>✨ Why EcoContext VoxID Shines</h3><br>
Voiceprint Magic: Extracts 32D voice signatures using a custom LSTM neural network.<br>
Smart Identification: Matches voices with pinpoint accuracy via cosine similarity.<br>
Context Wizardry: Adapts to noise and movement with a fuzzy logic brain, ensuring peak performance.<br>
Eco Power Mode: Optimizes energy use with dynamic power states—save the planet while you identify!<br>
Slick GUI: A colorful Tkinter interface for registering users, identifying voices, and simulating contexts.<br>
Audio Flexibility: Record live audio or conjure simulated samples for instant testing.<br>

<h3>🚀 Get Started</h3><br>
Prerequisites<br>
Python: 3.12+ (the fresher, the better!)<br>
Libraries:pip install numpy librosa scikit-fuzzy tensorflow matplotlib tkinter sounddevice<br>

<h3>🎮How to Play</h3>
Fire It Up:<br>
Run main.py to unleash the vibrant Tkinter GUI.:<br>
Register Your Voice::<br>
Hit the "Register User" tab.:<br>
Type a cool user ID.:<br>
Click "Record Voice Sample" to capture your voice or "Generate Fake Audio" for a quick test.:<br>
Press "Register User" to lock in your voiceprint.:<br>

Identify the Speaker::<br>
Switch to the "Identify User" tab.:<br>
Record a fresh sample or use a simulated one from a registered user.:<br>
Click "Identify User" to reveal the match with a confidence score!:<br>

Simulate the Scene::<br>
Head to the "Context Simulation" tab.:<br>
Tweak noise and movement sliders to mimic real-world vibes.:<br>
Click "Simulate Context" to see sensitivity, power mode, and battery life in action, complete with a snazzy bar plot.:<br>

<h3>🛠️Under the Hood</h3><br>
1. VoiceprintExtractor: The Voice Alchemist<br>

Mission: Turns audio into unique 32D voiceprints.
Input: 3-second audio clips (16 kHz), transformed into 40 MFCC features (128 time steps).<br>
Tech: A dazzling LSTM neural network (TensorFlow/Keras):<br>
Input: (128, 40)<br>
Layers: LSTM (64 units) → Dropout (0.3) → LSTM (32 units) → Dense (64, ReLU) → Dense (32, no activation)<br>
Output: A 32D voiceprint that’s as unique as you are!<br>
Heads-Up: The model is untrained out of the box—train it with a dataset like VoxCeleb to unlock its full potential.<br>

<h3>💭Outputs:</h3><br>
Sensitivity (0–100): Fine-tunes audio processing.<br>
Power mode (0–100): Sets the energy vibe (eco, balanced, performance).<br>


Rules: Five clever rules (e.g., noisy room → crank sensitivity, chilling → go eco).<br>


Note: Movement is currently a random placeholder—add a real sensor for next-level accuracy.<br>

3.EnergyOptimizer: The Power Maestro<br>

Mission: Keeps energy use lean and green.<br>
Power States:<br>
Sleep: 5 mW (snooze mode)<br>
Listening: 14 mW (all ears)<br>
Processing: 25 mW (full throttle)<br>


Logic: Picks the perfect state based on power mode.<br>
Battery Life: Predicts runtime for a 1000 mAh battery at 3.7V—stay powered longer!<br>

4.EcoContextVoxID: The Mastermind<br>

Mission: Ties it all together for seamless operation.<br>
Powers:<br>
Stores user voiceprints<br>
Identifies users with a 0.7 cosine similarity threshold.<br>
Processes context for adaptive performance.<br>
Handles audio recording and simulation like a champ.<br>



5. VoxIDApp: The Visual Showstopper<br>

Mission: Delivers a user-friendly, eye-catching GUI.<br>
Tabs:<br>
Register User: Add new voices with flair.<br>
Identify User: Spot speakers with confidence.<br>
Context Simulation: Play with settings and watch the magic unfold.<br>


Perks: Live status updates, a user listbox, and a matplotlib-powered plot that pops.<br>

<h3>📊 Data & Models</h3><br>

<h4>Datasets:</h4><br>
No external datasets—this system creates its own spark!<br>
Audio:<br>
Live recordings via sounddevice (16 kHz, 3 seconds).<br>
Simulated audio with np.random.normal for testing.<br>


Context:<br>
Noise: Extracted from audio energy.<br>
Movement: Randomly generated (accelerometer-ready).<br>


User Data: Voiceprints stored in a snappy in-memory dictionary.<br>


<h4>🤖AI Models:</h4><br>
Voiceprint Extraction: A custom LSTM neural network (needs training to shine).<br>
Fuzzy Logic: A rule-based system that’s sharp and adaptive.<br>
Note: Train the neural network with a dataset like VoxCeleb for real-world wow.<br>
